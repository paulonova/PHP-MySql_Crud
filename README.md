# PHP-MySql_Crud part-1

<p>PHP is a popular programming language and the foundation of many smart, data-driven websites. 
I will use PHP to build interconnected webpages with dynamic content which can pass data between pages.</p> 
<p>Will build how PHP can simplify the creation of forms, read and validate form data, and display errors. 
I will also cover the fundamentals of MySQL and how to use PHP to efficiently and securely interact with a database to store 
and retrieve data, providing practical advice and examples of best practices.</p>
<h3>Topics include:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Organizing project files</li>
  <li>Including and requiring files</li>
  <li>Working with URL parameters</li>
  <li>Encoding dynamic content</li>

# PHP-MySql part-2

<p>This is a second part of PHP with MySQL and learn the intermediate concepts necessary to develop real-world web 
applications while creating a working content management system. </p>
<p>I will demonstrate how to hide content from the public and to write functions which are context-sensitive and use argument options for conditional behavior.</p> 
I show how to implement <strong>user authentication and utilize PHP's built-in password functions to securely regulate page access</strong>. 
<p>Finally, I will show how related database tables can become nested resources by modifying and scoping functions providing practical examples of best practices.
